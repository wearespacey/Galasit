## Basic Overview
The most important and biggest problem when working in a building with several floors of openspaces is _to find some good place_ that suits you. You might want to work in a silent area or maybe you are more productive if you can talk with the people around you?
GalaSit helps you find the best seat in the best bubble on Mars depending on the real-time atmosphere, number of people, air quality,... and so on! It even lets you book it to make sure nobody will take away from you.
As this project is based on the use of micro-services, you can of course build on top of it, adding your own components and ideas. This is what makes GalaSit a good choice!
